                  Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with
                  the utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes
                  interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.
                </p>

                Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down
                some ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things
                through before committing to an actual design project.
              </p>
              <p>
                But then I found a
                <a href="https://flowbite.com"
                  >component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite</a
                >. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
                buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which
                are conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind
                CSS.
              </p>
              <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
              <p>
                First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This
                library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of
                components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste
                from the documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
                components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you
                can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can check out the
                <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/"
                  >quickstart guide</a
                >
                to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your
                project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I
                recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
                purge and minify the generated CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing
                UI, and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your
                projects even faster. You can check out this
                <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/"
                  >comparison table</a
                >
                to better understand the differences between the open-source and
                pro version of Flowbite.

              <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
              <p>
                While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are
                some key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to
                  exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user
                  journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By
                  running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will
                  interact with your design once it’s live;
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your
                  GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your
                  prototype to your data protection team and they can test it
                  for real;
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help
                  explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a
                  hands-on experience;
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an
                  interactive medium to preview and test design elements,
                  designers and developers can understand each other — and the
                  project — better.
                </li>
              </ol>

        }
      }
